# Archipelago Manual for Tekken 3

## Welcome
Welcome to my **Archipelago Manual** for **Tekken 3** on PlayStation. This manual uses the **Tekken 3 (Everything Unlocked)** version. If you already have a 100% unlocked save, you can use it as well. Having a fully completed save is highly recommended to finish a seed.

## Project Status
This project is currently in **beta**. Many new features will be added in future updates, as detailed in the **Upcoming Features** section below.

## General Information
Before starting a seed, please note the following:

- **Kuma** and **Panda** are treated as separate characters, even though they share a similar ending. To play as Panda, press **Cross** and **Circle** together.
- **Eddy** and **Tiger** are also distinct characters (each with its own ending). To play as Tiger, press **Triangle** while highlighting Eddy.
- **Mokujin** appears in two versions: **M (Male)** – use **Square** or **Triangle** – and **F (Female)** – use **Cross** or **Circle**. You are not required to clear the seed with both versions; this distinction is only for future variety in objectives.
- This manual covers the full game and all its solo modes.

## Known Bugs
- The **All Arcade Mode Clear** goal is not yet reflected in the spoiler log, but you can still complete it manually.

## Objectives (Goals)
- **All Arcade Mode Clear**  
  Complete Arcade Mode with each character, except Mokujin (only one version is required).

- **King of Iron Fist Tournament Token**  
  Collect all tokens named **KIFT Emblem**.

## Upcoming Features
- **New Goals**: Additional objectives for more variety.  
- **Mode Exclusion Option**: Ability to disable specific game modes during seed generation.  
- **New Checks**: Checks for Team Battle mode and fun checks based on Tekken lore.  
- **Difficulty Settings**: Adjustable difficulty levels and the option to disable them.

## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0
**Initial Release**  
- Created categories: **Characters**, **Game Modes**, **Difficulty**  
- Added the two Goals listed above  
- Implemented checks for each character in Arcade, Time Attack, Survivor, Tekken Ball, and Tekken Force modes
