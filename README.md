# Manual Archipelago for Tekken 3

## Welcome!
Welcome to my Archipelago manual for **Tekken 3** on Playstation. For this Manual Archipelago, I use the version **Tekken 3 (Everything Unlocked)** or if you already have a save with everything unlocked, that works too. It is highly recommended to have a 100% save to complete a seed.

## Project Status
This project is currently in **beta**. I plan to add many additional features in future updates, as detailed in the **Future Features** section below.

## This Manual Archipelago includes the full game as well as all its single-player modes.

## Character Information
There are different things to know before starting a seed on the characters:
- **Kuma and Panda** are considered two different characters even though they share the same ending (for Panda, you need to use the cross and circle buttons on your Playstation controller)
- **Eddy and Tiger**, like Kuma and Panda, are two different characters with the difference that they do not share the same ending (to play as Tiger, press Triangle on Eddy)
- **Mokujin** is differentiated by two different genders: **(M) Male** (to play as him, use square or triangle button) and **(F) Female** (to play as her, use cross and circle). You are not required to do checks with both, this is just for future goals with differentiation.

## Game Mode Information
- **Arcade Mode**: You just need to complete arcade mode with each character you have available.
- **Team Battle**: Currently, there are no checks for this mode; work in progress for the next update.
- **Survival Mode**: Just the survival mode with checks at 10 wins for each character at the moment.
- **Tekken Ball**: Defeat your opponent at volleyball, but **you can only face the playable characters you have unlocked**.
- **Tekken Force**: Complete the game mode with each character. **WARNING: Even if the mode is unlocked, you cannot play it unless you have unlocked the first "Progressive Tekken Force Stage"**, adding a slight gating mechanic (to check if this causes generation issues).

## Known Bugs
- The goal **All Arcade Mode Clear** currently does not work in spoiler log logic, but this does not prevent you from completing it manually; it only breaks the spoiler log.
