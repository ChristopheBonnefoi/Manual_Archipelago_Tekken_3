# Manual Archipelago for Tekken 3

## Welcome!
Welcome to my Archipelago manual for **Tekken 3** on the PlayStation. For this Manual Archipelago, I use the **Tekken 3 (Everything Unlocked)** version. If you already have a save file with everything unlocked, that works too. It is highly recommended to use a 100% save file to complete a seed.

## Project Status
This project is currently in **beta**. I plan to add many new features in future updates, as detailed in the **Planned Features** section below.

## General Information
There are a few things to know before starting a seed, especially regarding characters:

- **Kuma and Panda** are considered two different characters, even though they share the same ending. (To play as Panda, use the Cross and Circle buttons on your PlayStation controller.)
- **Eddy and Tiger** are also treated as two separate characters. Unlike Kuma and Panda, they have different endings. (To play as Tiger, press Triangle while selecting Eddy.)
- **Mokujin** is split into two distinct genders: **(M) Male** (Square or Triangle) and **(F) Female** (Cross or Circle). You’re not required to complete checks with both versions, but this distinction is made for potential future goals.
- This Manual Archipelago includes the full game and all its single-player modes.

## Known Bugs
- The goal **All Arcade Mode Clear** does not currently work within spoiler log logic. However, it can still be completed manually—it just breaks spoiler progression tracking.

## Goals

- **All Arcade Mode Clear**  
  Finish Arcade Mode with each character, except Mokujin—you only need to complete it with one version (either M or F, not both).

- **King of Iron Fist Tournament Token**  
  Finish the game while collecting all the tokens named: KIFT Emblem.

## Planned Features (subject to change)

- **New Goals**: Additional goals to further diversify the gameplay experience.
- **Exclude Certain Game Modes**: Currently, all game modes are included in seed randomization.
- **New Checks**: Future checks for Team Battle mode and some fun lore-based checks for Tekken.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Adjustable difficulty settings in item generation and the ability to exclude certain items.

## Changelog

### Version 0.1.1

**Changes**
- Fixed Mokujin logic so checks can be done with either version (M or F)
- Updated **All Arcade Mode Clear** goal to allow either Mokujin version

### Version 0.1.0

**Changes**
- Created item categories: **Characters**, **Game Mode**, and **Difficulty**
- Added the two goals mentioned above
- Added checks for each character in the following modes: Arcade, Time Attack, Survival, Tekken Ball, Tekken Force
